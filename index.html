        Hello I am an aspiring doctor with a goal to help people mentally and physically. There are many reasons why I want to become a doctor. First being is as I was growing up I was always scared of going to doctor appointments but was attending them obviously. My mother was a nurse so she knew the doctors who would check me out everytime which in a way made me feel more comfortable with them. Then overtime I started to ask questions everytime I went to my doctor appointments which resulted in the doctors letting me check out their office on different occasions. I learned a lot about what they do and what they decide to become doctors. Also I noticed the amount of people that they made smile everyday. From that I actually came to a realization that I would want to be a doctor just like them and make people smile as well as healthy. Another reason I was so interested in becoming a doctor was because of the passing of my mother when I was eleven years old. My mother got sick so she went to the hospital where she spent about two weeks before she passed away. The issue is none of the doctors she was seeing were able to figure out what was wrong with her as she kept getting worse and worse. That resulted in the death of my mother and of course I am not angry at any of the doctors who were unable to figure out what was wrong with my mother. The doctors tried their best to figure out what was wrong to try and save her. So when my mother passed away I decided that being a doctor to help other people out was very important. I figured that maybe I could try to be the best doctor I can to hopefully save people who are important to others just as my mother was to me. Saving patients is my goal. I want to be able to be that doctor that figures out what is going on with someone to make them feel better. All in all being a doctor is my dream as well as saving peoples lives.  <br><br>
